#FastqKnowledge

#####Philip Braunstein (pbraunstein12@gmail.com)

FastqKnowledge is an educational program that allows students to interact with FASTQ files.

The fastqKnowledge.py script should be launched from the command line
with a single command line argument that is a valid FASTQ file.

As this program is an educational tool, it is recommended for use with FASTQ
files in the range of 10 - 100 Mb. It will work with larger files; however, it
will take several minutes to load a file of Gb orders of magnitude.

Sample1.fastq is a FASTQ file from the 1000 Genomes project that is in the
appropriate size range
